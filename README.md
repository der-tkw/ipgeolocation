# IP Geo Location
IP Geo Location is a Chrome Extension which you can find and install [here].

### Features
 - Display your current external IP
 - Display a country-specific icon of the location of that IP
 - Display longitude/latitude (optional)
 - Display a google map snippet of your current location

### Notes
The extension is using a free service to determine your IP ([jsonip.com]) and another free service to fetch geo location data for that IP ([freegeoip.net]). If there seems to be a problem with a specific IP or the resulting location data I can not do anything about it since I'm not in any way affiliated with the services the extension is using.

### Version
