# IP Geo Location
IP Geo Location is a Chrome Extension which you can find and install [here].

### Features
 - Dark Mode Support (depending on OS)
 - Display your current external IP
 - Display a country-specific icon, country, city and region
 - Display longitude/latitude (optional)
 - Display a map of your current location (powered by [OpenLayers] and [OpenStreetMap])
 - Auto refresh mode
 - Silent mode
 - Notifications

### Notes
The extension is using a free service to determine your IP and geo location data ([ipinfo.io]). If there seems to be a problem with a specific IP or the resulting location data I can not do anything about it since I'm not in any way affiliated with the services the extension is using.

### Version
1.7
